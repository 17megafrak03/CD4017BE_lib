The CD4017BE_lib is a java library that is used by my Minecraft mods. It contains:
- basic shared code like Network Handlers and basic Block/Item types.
- code templates for specific objects and utility methods that are used very often in my mods.
- mod APIs used to let my mods interact with each other and with other mods.
